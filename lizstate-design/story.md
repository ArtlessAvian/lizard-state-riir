# Story

Spoiler warning.

Lizard State takes place on an tidally locked planet where the cold side of the planet supports life. Humans arrive to colonize, but disrupt the lives of the native "travellers" living there.

The point of view follows one lonely traveller (Nano) and two cloned travellers with human memories (Vi, Max). Throughout the story, they work to represent humans and reconcile with travellers, but fail to address problems and their consequences, sometimes creating new problems. Through adventuring, meeting people, and understanding their life, they are able to come to a rough but stable state.

The story *should* and *must* explicitly invoke the negativity of colonialism, and the uncomfortable implications that has. Attempts to ignore it in the story should be treated poorly. Attempts to frame it as "helping" should be treated poorly.

            * No other intelligent life has been found.

            * (not really important, but explains the irrational expansionism and need for infinite growth)

* The story is in the "Pacific Sector"
    * Humans speak a tonal creole, mainly Mandarin and English.
    * English is the informal register. Mandarin is the formal register.

* The planet is tidally locked
    * The hot side is unlivable, and constantly evaporating water and acid.
    * The cold side is livable but almost always raining acid with small gaps.
        * Life has evolved to work with this.
        * Most lifes' common ancestor was able to communicate basic "emotions" through whatever medium (like radio waves, but irrelevant to the story.)

* The colony
    * Every colony's mission is to be able to send another colony ship with crew and materials to whatever planet.
        * A main ship is sent from wherever, and collects crew and materials from other planets along the way.
        * Near the end of the trip, a small party is assembled and sent to the planet ahead.
        * The main ship can stay in orbit, but ideally colonists aren't there permanently.
    * Specifically for this planet:
        * Available resources are solar energy.
        * Robots have prospected some valuable materials from the ground.
        * The planet is expected to be made habitable, enough to house the people en route.  
    * The colony space shuttle lands and settles antipodal to the sun.
    * The space shuttle is used as housing and as command for the initial party.

        * Cannot tell a falsehood/lie ("I am a human.")
    * Nouns are true if they exist. ("Vi.")

        * Can be reduced. ("[Someone] and Vi said Vi saw a human")
    * Can leave out information ("[Someone] said Vi saw a human").
        * Both sides of a true AND statement are true.
    * Can tell implications ("If Vi is a human, then I saw a human.")
    * Trivial implication loophole ("If [false], then there once was a traveller who...")
        * Listeners are aware that the consequent does not matter.
        * This is an advanced trick that needs to be learned from another.
    * Consistent?
        * No known ways of speaking lies as truth.
        * If possible, travellers would be unprepared.

* Travellers can communicate arbitrarily fast.
    * This is not necessary except for extreme situations

# Characters

## Nano
Nano travels alone. They find Max unconscious, and takes care of him for a bit. They intend to abandon him at a gathering, but is drawn into an investigation that Max seems aware of. They become entangled in human affairs. Repeatedly Nano finds themself opposing old friends with less than positive opinions on humans. Stuck between telling the truth to his new and old friends, it becomes more and more tempting to hide away forever with humans.

"Axolotls" generally live closer to the hot side of the planet. They superficially appear like axolotls from Earth, but their "gills" are more like radio antennae. They are "louder" than most travellers. Some are able to weaponize their emotions and "communicate" them to their prey when hunting. They are also more perceptive, able to learn to pick up and interpret the emotions of non-traveller life.

Nano is supportive but secretive. They are interested in learning to speak with humans. Nano has absolutely no body language or expressions, as do most travellers.

### Past Nano
Nano is an experienced adventurer. They used to travel with another (temporarily named "Sed").
The two explored all over, Nano interested in learning everything about the world, while Sed interested in helping those along the way, especially Nano. In a strange encounter, the two find themselves fighting an undescribable monster. Nano escapes with their life, at the request of Sed. And it turns out Sed is fine. Walking is hard, and that's fine, right? Nano doesn't ask what happened in there. They can only imagine the worst of the worst. They should've stayed. And when Sed is safely back at the gathering, Nano is guilty. Guilty of abandoning. So there's no difference if he just leaves. And he does.

Before all that, Nano and his relative (of some sort) Pico travelled inland from the equator. Pico was a danger to himself and others, and the colder climate would help. They made their way to a gathering, where by chance Sed was there to receive them. Sed was happy to help at the gathering, but was also thinking of going on the move. Sed offered Nano to explore, and so the story goes. Pico would hear stories about the two, and even heard some directly from the source. But suddenly those stories stopped.

## Max
Max is the POV character at the start of the story. He has amnesia. This isn't fun, he has splitting headaches and can't speak, aphasia. He is also a "lizard" and a weird axolotl is talking to him somehow. Recovering at a gathering, he overhears news about travellers being attacked by... a robot? The others notice his understanding, which he did not mean to give away. Looks like he can't pretend to be a lizard forever. But who is he anyways?

"Monitors" are nimble and precise. They can snap to action at the drop of a hat, but have a tendency to overheat. Naturally, they're usually found in the colder regions of the planet. They have long, strong tails for balance, perfectly controlling their rotational inertia and momentum like a falling cat. And for use as a whip. 

Max cannot speak human language. In the presence of humans, he is a silent protagonist. Max can only observe, and maybe try to communicate. As he forms his opinions and personality, he is no longer ok with just being passive. He is very expressive, approximating many human expressions and some extreme non-human expressions.

### Human Max
Max was the child of two colonists. He was the first generation on his planet. But that also means his parents were a little busy. Too busy for him. Their work was very important, and very tiring. He just did his own thing. As a kid he would look for approval, but he didn't try anymore. He drifted from hobby to hobby. From media to media. At some point he decided to get an education too. But there wasn't a point to it. He was tired and didn't have anything to do, didn't have anything to make him useful. Well, he was suited to leave the planet and colonize another. So, whatever.

Human Max bums around the colony. As the resident atmospheric engineer, just like his parents, he is super excited to make this planet livable for humans. Not. Affecting the rain could have dangerous effects to everyone here. So he just makes himself busy. Still just drifting. He could just run out into the rain, but they'd just clone and replace him, he was too important to the mission nobody wanted to do. Actually they did clone him, but like, weirdly. He did agree to it when he signed the papers. Lizard Max is no fun, doesn't talk after he went missing. But he seems like he knows what he's doing. Wonder if its any fun.

## Vi
Vi was made in a lab. She is disgusted by herself, her false memories and her appearance. She's her own person, not who everyone says she is. But she's also not the murder machine she sees in the mirror. She finds some comfort that another "experiment," Max, is in the same situation, a connection she cannot explain. But Max is not who she thinks he is, as is revealed with time. But mostly meeting "human Vi" and "human Max" in the planet colony. She feels betrayed.

On a mission together, Vi and Max are stuck in the rain. After a brief but intense spat, Max breaks away, and when Vi catches up, she finds him unconscious and in critical condition. She can't assess the damage eaxctly. All she can do is move him to safety, and return with help. And when she returns, he is missing. Vi feels a sourness in her pulse. Much later, the humans do find Max, after he destroyed a robot for attention. She goes looking for him, only to find many eyes on her. And in their concentrated stare, she starts to hear them. And she worries about the two captives still being researched at the colony.

"Gators" are methodic and wise. Specialized organs filter acid from their blood and store them to be spat out. An experienced gator can aim at targets, while young gators just make an acid mess of whatever is in front of them. Fighters (and bored civilians) have been known to actively drink rainwater, or even concentrated pools. This has also lead to some drinking competitions being held. They tend to be found in deep caves, where the rainwater collects into giant concentrated pools of acid.

Vi plays her cards close to her chest. She usually speaks in a formal register when it is not necessary. As she grows closer to the humans in the colony, she starts to adopt a more regular tone. She has secrets and opinions and judgements, but finds the "words" to tell Max and Nano what she thinks. And they work to process her thoughts together.

### Human Vi
Vi's family had a normal life. Except, for want of luxuries. Her dad was sick. Her mom was stuck doing research that didn't seem to go anywhere. Both wanted more time before they were too old. So, Vi and her older siblings were looking to make themselves important. Vi wasn't too interested. She took a few courses in theoretical exobiology on the side, but it wasn't useful, unlike her major, Planetary Logistical Management. Vi doesn't hold grudges. Except for one person. Who she can't seem to escape, even as she left the planet. She did plan to help her family with what importance she could get, although she did not expect any help back. She never did.

Vi is lying in bed in a dark room. White noise hisses from speakers overhead. Somewhere near her, a crocodile sits at dim screens, getting work done for her. Vi can't seem to do it herself. There's not really any point. Lying that things are happening, when anything to be done is disaster. Why is she even here. She wished she could study the two captured lifeforms some more, but she let them go after she realized they were a little *too* smart. Sorry, "Lizard Vi" did. She didn't do anything. Maybe she should study herself instead? And by herself, she means "Lizard Vi." Nah. They weren't the same people, and even if she were, she wouldn't enjoy being studied. Which she probably had to do anyways. Why did she agree to have her memories copied? To create a clone who hates herself? That's cruel. But also, Vi had a feeling that the alien who had her memories, hated her. The human.

## Levin and Cook
<!-- IDK why this came out as four story elements instead of the previous pattern of story, description. -->

Cook found the structure first, when we were trying to find the coldest place there is. It's rough and debatable of course, but we had it about pinned down, and we were wandering. Anyways, the structure. Above ground, not a cave. Sort of like the gathering place we frequent, a cave entrance with close to no walls, like stilts holding up a giant rock. But not a rock. Perfectly flat sides, colors, shapes, undescribable. It provided shelter from the rain. But not a cave, so no food. It was cold, and smooth, and echoed? When we hit it, it echoed, but no other sounds we made did. More research required.

Levin and I were frozen in time. We both saw it. It wasn't the "thing" that others have been talking about. They said it was smaller, and moved in straight lines, and didnt care about the rain. After it stopped raining, this monster came out from above us, from inside the structure. We were hungry, we were scared. We made poor decisions. We were trapped, and taken away to a completely alien world.

<!-- Mid Act 1 -->

[I think they're trying to feed us,] I said hopefully. Cook didn't say anything, they haven't been looking too good. I couldn't get a read on the alien, like it had no emotion. They tried to do a few tests on us, but left us alone after we beat the crap out of them. I think. They were too big to hurt. I learned a few things they would respond positively to. They weren't hostile, but we were still jailed against our will. I could probably make a break for it, but I'd have to leave Cook behind, an impossibility. So I stayed. One day I heard a traveller through the walls, one of us. I raised my distress signal, and heard them come running. Not an alien, a traveller coming closer. Their footsteps on the floor did not match the long stride of an alien. And the door opened on its own? And from my cage I saw a gator like Cook, but without a scar on their body. They let us out, but had no history when I asked. Like they did nothing their entire life. They couldn't have been too young, but also not as old as us. They were breathing noisily while they spoke, and I tried to quiet them but they swatted my hands away. How rude. Brazenly they left through the door without any sense of stealth. But the aliens let us go. The two of us carried Cook out to a cave, and we went to look for food.

<!-- Mid Act 2 or 3 -->

Vi and Cook didn't talk. They kept to themselves. Didn't even look at each other. Walked in search of food. This cave was fairly lifeless, mostly just plants. Why couldn't I have had an "exciting, eye-opening" trip, thought Vi, like Max and Levin did?. Cook signaled danger. Vi dismissed it. False alarm, as always. Was Cook warning me about this little curb? Is this normal? Vi climbed up the ledge, brushed herself off, and turned around to look at Cook. Cook signaled danger. Vi did not sense anything behind her, but trusted them anyways. She spun around and sensed nothing. She was furious. Is this some sort of prank? Cook signaled danger. Suddenly she felt very strange. Slowly and intentfully, she took a few steps away, then turned to look from the side. Are you scared of me? Through the blank emotionless poker face she saw, she could sense the faint answer. [Yes.] And Vi couldn't say much back. [That makes sense.]

## Sed
Sed isn't actually mad. No, really. Truly. Like, fundamental truth of the world. Sed forgives Nano. Sometimes they do feel a bit sad, bitter, angry, but that's ok. If Sed sees Nano, they are going to beat them up a little. Nano would probably not fight back, Sed knows what they're like. But then they would get better. Maybe go on an adventure again? Show them what a human is? Sed is ok that her time is over. Sed just wishes Nano would write back.

"Iguanas" are. They aren't super special, they can do a bit of everything. They're definitely unique and colorful. (Sed is mostly red.) They're a bit rare and keep to themselves. Its rare to see one travelling with a non-iguana. In pairs, they learn skills to cover their partners' weaknesses. They recover fast too.

<!-- After the story -->

Sed sensed two familiar axolotls, somewhere within the foggy rain, rushing to the cave entrance. They grabbed a "towel" in preparation. Pico arrived first. And when they do, they shout. "Fuck!". And they shook the rain off their body. Sed raised her towel to block the spray. Nano then arrived, equally as drenched. They struggled to uninvert their umbrella. [That didn't work,] they thought out loud. They then threw the umbrella out into the rain. Sed peeked out from behind the towel. Nano just stood there, the rain dripping off his antennae. Sed took this as an excuse to tackle them. [Nano!!! What the hell happened out there.] Nano shrugged. [Got a little greedy. Though I still wish I brought even more food back. Where is Pico anyways?] Nano sent out a quick ping, and found Pico among the machines, already preparing the meat for dehydration and preservation. [They're not so greedy. At least we have the moss from hydroponics.]

# Motivations, Relations

## Groups
Remember, groups are not monoliths. Nobody wants to be evil. Maybe they justify that their plans come at the "acceptable" cost of someone else.

* Central command pushes the colony to provide housing for humans on the planet. The humans on the spaceship were promised a place to live. Should that promise have been made? Probably not. But its done.

* The colony does not want to cause trouble. They are caught between two groups and really, really, wish they weren't there.

* Anti-cargo travellers aren't (derogatory) luddites. But they are luddites. Humans provide the tech, and travellers can't rely on them. Otherwise, its easy to be pressured or swayed to human wants, which generally are not good for travellers.

* Pro-cargo travellers make use of human tech, and do not care about being reliant on humans to provide them. If travellers have them, they might as well use them.

* Anti-human travellers wants no humans on the planet. By extension, they are anti-colony. The colony alone has already caused more harm than good. More of them is worse, and humans want to change everything about their world.

* Pro-colony travellers are ok with the colony, but no more than that. The colony has real, communicative people they can reason with. And they are reasonable.

* Pro-humans travellers are ok with humans. Whatever. If things go to shit, then its not my problem.

## Individuals
Max is bored. He has a naive idea of "being a good person." He is also very ungrounded, having no role models or experience. Only media.
* Max is literally neutral on everything.
* He has no opinion of himself.
* Max is friendly towards Vi, and through shenanigans settles into a situationship.
* Max looks up to Nano as a guide, but often works his own way through the world.

Vi allows herself to be hostile. She is a jerk, but she still earns people's trust. She makes the unpopular decisions only she can make. Except for the decisions she can't. Like dooming humans or travellers. If she pretends she has it under control, then everything will be ok. Everything will be ok.
* Vi is pro-colony, anti-human.
* She wants to preserve culture and is cautiously anti-cargo, but will provide if needed.
* Vi is distrustful towards Max and has no idea how to label their relation, but completely warms up him again.
* Vi torments herself by habit, but has a shaky self-image.
* Vi respects Nano, but holds them at at distance until more trust is built.

Nano has seen things. They're still curious, but that passion is a little faded and sad. They have experience. But they also have experience they would rather not have had. 
*  Nano is selfishly pro-cargo and pro-colony. It's a completely new life that they can hide away in.
* They see themselves in Max's inexperience and Vi's curiosity, and have a lot to learn from both their technical experience.
* Nano doesn't like to think about their history too much, but other than that they are self-confident.

## Secondary Characters

Levin is loyal to Cook. They may disagree, but they always figure things out in the end.
* The threat of humans does not concern Levin, since they haven't arrived yet!
* Max's aloofness annoys him, and encourages Max to convince him of what is right. Through violence.
* Vi is cute. But Cook is better. They're very alike.
* Nano is an old friend and role model. Both curious, but Levin is much more brave.
* Sed is an old friend. They're still alive and kicking. But I don't want to bother Nano about it.
* Pico is awkward. Wonders what Nano and Pico think about each other.

Cook is the first affected by humans. They rightfully have a grudge against humans. But they do care deeply about everyone, in a quiet way.
* Anti-human. But allows them to exist for Levin's sake.
* Neutral of Max. Knows he is Levin's clone, but the two are too different to be concerning.
* Afraid of Vi. Too standoffish. Not interested in knowing each other.
* Nano is an old friend, sure. Where is Sed? Isn't that messed up?
* Sed is a closer friend than Nano. Shares the same goal of serving the people.
* Pico is worrying. With the gathering disbanded, are they doing fine on their own?

Human Max sees himself as heroic, and is anti-human and very pro-cargo.
* Lizard Max is ironically his role model. But his view of Lizard Max is very distorted. 
* Is friendly with Lizard Vi.
* Has a unfortunate one-sided relation with Human Vi. Just because your clones are friends doesn't make you friends.
* Is aware of Levin. Provides supplies, feigning ignorance that its Lizard Max. Too many supplies.

Human Vi is completely burnt out and cannot express her opinion.
* She is ok with Lizard Max.
* She is afraid of Lizard Vi. She knows she does not like herself. So by extension, Lizard Vi does not like her. Right?
* Does not care about Human Max. Human Max is her direct report. She is not friends with her direct reports.

Sed misses Nano. But their aim is getting better.
* Aware of Max.
* Aware of Vi.
* Very aware of Nano. Wishes they would write back.
* Concerned for Pico. Pico is missing?

Pico is a bit bitter about everything. They are an opportunist though. We ball.
* Neutral about the colony and humans.
* Jealous of Max's relation with Nano.
* Dislikes Vi's stance on cargo.
* Feels abandoned by Nano. Its true.
* Sed is stuck somewhere else. Wishes they could meet. Sends letters to each other. (Also forges letters to Nano.)

## Parallels
The naive association is by species. And there are trivial similarities there.

Thematically, however:
* (Human) Max and Pico
    * Neglected by their caretakers.
    * Low-no opinion on themselves.
    * Lives vicariously through others.
* Vi and Levin
    * Very strong conviction at the cost of themselves.
    * Fight for what is right.
    * Cares about the stories of others.
* Nano and Cook
    * Human related trauma to be overcome.
    * Strong relations to Sed.
    * Stilted relations towards others.


# Conflict and Related Events

## Offscreen (Before the story)

Travellers are confused and scared of automated human robots, followed by the arrival of humans proper. Levin and Cook bravely try to investigate, but are captured and held against their will.

## Act 1
Act 1 sets up everything. The premise, the plot, and the main characters. Also hides a Chekov's gun as a character.

Events of act 1 is totally ordered.

1) Max is hurt. Nano keeps Max alive, and Max gets marginally better.

2) Max is able to explain humans and robots. He is not aware of what is happening with the human colony. Nano introduces Pico to Max. Pico is made aware of humans.

3) Max destroys a robot and brings back evidence. Vi finds the gathering and is made aware of travellers. Nano and Max are held for questions. Pico and Nano have stilted conversation.

4) Vi is able to free Levin and Cook, and they return to the gathering where Max is.

5) Vi is unable to explain herself and Max well. She cannot explain humans at all. She fortells doomsday and a reason to panic. Panic ensues.

6) Humans arrive to take Max and Vi away. The gathering disbands.

## Offscreen (Intermission?)
* Nano returns to the human colony.
* Max recovers, still has aphasia.

## Act 2
Act 2 describes the unavoidable erosion of old traveller life, to new ways of life with human influence. This is initially negative, but there are some positives.

Events are unordered. All three must be completed.

* Nano is afraid for the gathering, seeing everyone scatter. They and either Max or Vi travel to find former residents, and convince them of the safety. However, Nano cannot demonstrate that he is real, "strangely" being unable to answer some questions. This does not increase trust in Nano.

* Humans try to appease travellers with gifts of technology. However, most of the tech turns out to be completely useless, or actively harmful. The only technology that seem to be of interest are bandages and medicine, and a device to locate each other (which they can already do).

* Travellers are afraid of doomsday as Vi fortold. The trio is sent to explain human intentions. But there is no positive spin to be made.

This event must be completed to progress.

1) Levin and Cook want to speak with Nano privately, and Nano leaves on their own. Max and Vi barge in. The two parties escalate and have a small fight. Max and Vi lose. Nano does not participate. Pico can be seen if you snoop around.

There's less panic, but travellers are still unsure about humans. Max and Vi are still symbolic of the unknown, at least they have limits. What humans actually are still a mystery to most.

Events are unordered. Three or more must be completed before progressing.

* Max wants to improve the gathering place. He and another haul a heavy appliances over. The "television" is not useful at all. The "fridge" does not see any use.

* Nano hears of a disaster. They and another rush to the location. A pair of travellers attempt to dismantle a robot as Max had done, but get themselves pinned. Nano freezes, leaving the other to destroy the robot.

* Vi wants to learn about traveller lives before they change too much. She and another do a few interviews, but end up getting interviewed back. She answers as honestly as possible. In the end she realizes she could've asked travellersa about their lives at any time though, since they remember everything.

Some younger travellers aren't afraid of humans. They arrive at the ship to see them, to hang around the colony, to taunt humans, to try to get items/technology. Humans aren't looking for trouble. They do gift things, but that gets travellers into trouble. 

Events are unordered. Some amount must be completed before progressing.

* Nano describes the community act of "carrying mail." Vi is interested and wants to volunteer. She carries a message from a traveller at the colony and delivers it to the recipient. The recipient has mail for Nano. Nano does not accept the mail. Vi takes it anyways. The mail is from an anonymous sender, and is vaguely threatning towards Nano.

* Vi notices bandages being used as currency. She is interested in this development. She is also interested to see what she can trade for in bandages. However, she is horrified to see that travellers are taking bigger risks and getting themselves hurt. Humans have been providing bandages to travellers, but she cannot take them away. She decides to make bandages freely available from the colony.

* Max accidentally starts a fight club. The devices from before are being used to find other tech-savy travellers. The trio may choose to confiscate them, although they won't be taken without a fight.

### TODO: MORE EVENTS

## Act 3
Some travellers are getting brazen and actively hostile towards humans. Travellers divide themselves into pro-human and anti-human groups. Independently, groups of pro-cargo and anti-cargo form too.

The colony of humans are actually anti-human, but they cannot convincingly explain themselves. They also have trouble explaining to the humans arriving from space that they have done absolutely nothing towards their goals. Pressure increases for humans to actually do something.

Events are unordered. Some amount must be completed before progressing.

* At this point, the bandage economy has completely crashed. Distant bandage hoarders are furious. Vi and another personally go to calm them, but end up in a completely pointless all out brawl. The fight doesn't fix anything, but everyone decides to just go home.

* Max goes on an adventure to where the axolotls are. It's unbearably hot and Max ends up in trouble. Max and his adventuring partner make it to a gathering. News of humans hasn't diffused so far out, but people are at least aware of Max through news of Nano's reappearance. Max does his best to represent humans positively, to no response. It could've been worse. The party is reminded of Pico's existence, again.

* Nano seeks out Levin and Cook's old base of operations. They do locate it, and find way too many dismantled electronics than humans had accounted for. (Snooping around some more, the party can find Pico.) Levin and Cook appear to corner the party. The secret is already out, but the two parties fight with items. Levin and Cook do not use electronics in the fight. If Max is taken, he will not tell the humans about the electronics, but will steal a screwdriver from Levin and Cook. If Vi is taken, she will tell the humans and start an investigation.

### TODO: MORE EVENTS
## End Of Act 3

Sigh. I am a little embarrassed at this first-ish draft of the below. It's been in my head, but loosely. This rendition came out M for Mature or whatever. Also, everyone's allegiances are all over the place in a way that isnt supported with evidence. I feel like its almost an idiot plot, but everyone is the idiot?

At this point, a group of extremely human-neutral, pro-technology travellers have emerged. They do not care about humans and their eventual replacement, and intend to live out their lives recklessly. They have no name. Vi calls them a "death cult." Max calls them the "YOLO enthusiasts" to try to lighten the tone. (This document will use the second.)

1) Cook arrives at the colony in peace. Nano receives a third letter from them, and a message worrying about Levin. Max and Vi read it in secret. Nano is being challenged by the anonymous sender to a duel to the death. Vi presumes Nano's partner Sed is behind this, inferring they are anti-human. The two craft an anonymous letter with a time and date. They work to send it back and provide a watch. At the location of the duel, they do not notice the duel is being organized by YOLO enthusiasts.

2) Max and Vi leave, but actually hide until the time of the fight. The fight is about to begin, but Nano does not show up. (Nano has no idea what is happening.) Max and Vi are revealed and pushed into the fight instead, and Levin brings out their opponent. The opponent is revealed, Pico. Pico is definitely the challenger, and has the watch. Vi and Max lose decisively. Pico takes out a "dangerous weapon."

3) Nano arrives with Cook. Levin, actually a double agent, attacks Pico to drop the weapon. Nano and Pico scream at each other, affecting everyone else in the area. Nano gets ahold of the the weapon and shoots, at nothing, at Pico, or at himself. Everyone scatters. The weapon is a fake.

## Act 4?

Max and Vi return. Nano had left with Levin and Cook. The colony is shocked at the sudden escalation.

Human Max is found to have provided a weapon, fake or not. Human Max has already disappeared, along with a large supply of life support equipment, leaving behind a note. Max is questioned, but has no idea what Human Max is thinking.

Human Vi and Vi conspire and build confidence in each other. Human Vi resigns as colony leader and hands full control over to Vi. Vi fully intends to run the colony to serve travellers for their best interests, as much as possible. The colony is a bit relieved, but worries about the response from central command. Vi boldly declares her stance to central command, to little response or fanfare. "Figure it out."

Nano explains to Vi and Max that they were supposed to take care of Pico. Levin and Cook have been supporting Pico, but do not approve of everything. The full party goes to meet each other to apologize.

Nano reconciles with Sed. They can bring Sed to Pico, or bring Pico to Sed. Either way, he promises to visit and tell stories.

Max and a rescue party of travellers find Human Max at the entrance of a cave. He is fine, and aided by travellers despite trouble communicating. He does not want to return to the colony. Human Max could not convince himself to destroy the life suppport equipment, and had stashed them deep in the cave with the help of his aides. Human Max warns him that his allies are very strongly anti-human. Even if Max, Vi, or Nano were anti-human as well, the travellers in the cave would attack them. At any time, the party can try to retrieve (or destroy) the equipment in the depths of the cave, if they truly believe humans should (or should not) exist.

The story does not end with all tension resolved, but some hope that Vi can navigate the awkward unstable situation.

# Similarities, References

Intentional or not, similarities must be addressed.

## Intentional

* Text Editors
    * Main character naming.
        * Characters who think they can change the world.
        * Very bad associations:
            * Vi is stubborn and does not quit. Hard to control (as a player character).
            * Max is friendly, but can be serious if needed.
            * Nano is straightforward and gets the job done.
        * Pico is named in relation to Nano (units of measure), but secretly is also a text editor.
        * Sed is old! And still useful. Very comboable.

* Computer Science
    * Cook-Levin theorem, it is *very* hard to find a solution to a general expression.
    * Computer Networking
        * Ping, Broadcast, Scan, Ack, etc.

* Mother 3 
    * Abuse of technology
    * Loss of innocence
        * Subverted? Tazmily was never truly innocent, but they made themselves forget.
    * "Feeling strange"
        * Mechanically, makes you vulnerable and rewards you with new PSI for going through it.
    * Ending?

* Pokemon Mystery Dungeon - Parody? Premise. Escapism, fantasy, routine.

## Unintentional
* Avatar (the blue people movie i didn't watch) - The "human" main characters and alien setting.
    * The story should not center around Vi and Max. They don't get everything they want. The world would continue to exist without them.
    * Humans are not happy to go to "war."

* Sacagawea (from history, as usually simplified in elementary school) - The main trio.
    * Nano is not just a mentor character. Nano is always extremely relevant and connected to what is happening. Nano chooses to align with humans for imperfect reasons. Nano is self-sufficient and in control.
    * Vi and Max are not necessarily human aligned. There isn't anything stopping them from living as travellers. (They choose to work with humans.)
