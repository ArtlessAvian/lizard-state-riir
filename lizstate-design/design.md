# Design

Lizard State is a dungeon crawler where you push your luck. Exploring a series of caves, you must buff yourself and conserve resources as much as possible before exiting the cave to move to the next. Successes chain into more success, but failure leads to a rocky recovery.

# Gameplay Similarities

The dungeon crawler inspirations of this game are an interpolation of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup. It should be more complex than PMD, and less complex than DCSS.

Off-genre inspirations are Monster Hunter and fighting games. Both feature committal actions and stuff.
